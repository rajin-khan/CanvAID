## üöß Currently Under Development

CanvAID is actively being built to transform how students interact with their Canvas course materials. We're in the early development phase, working hard to bring you something special.

## What is CanvAID?

CanvAID is designed to be your calm, intelligent study companion that helps you make sense of scattered course materials across your Instructure Canvas LMS courses. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by PDFs, announcements, and assignments spread across multiple classes, CanvAID brings clarity and organization to your academic life.

### Our Vision

We believe learning should feel like a gentle flow, not a frantic scramble. CanvAID transforms the overwhelming chaos of digital course materials into organized, accessible knowledge that empowers genuine understanding and academic success.

### Core Philosophy

**Enhancement, Not Replacement** - We provide the foundation and clarity you need to excel in your studies, while ensuring you do the thinking and learning yourself. Academic integrity isn't just important to us‚Äîit's fundamental to everything we build.



## Contributing

We're not quite ready for external contributions yet, but we're excited to welcome contributors once we have our foundation solidly in place. Watch this repo for updates!

CanvAID is being built by developers who understand the daily challenges of modern digital learning environments. We're students and former students ourselves, and we're building the tool we wish we had during our academic journeys.
